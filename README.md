# Mario Kart Track Evaluations
This application is designed primarily for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, but will support the new Mario Kart coming later in 2025.

# Purpose
If you ever wanted to know your best and worst courses when playing Mario Kart, primarily in a competitive environment, then this application is for you.  Simply search up the track of choice, and then enter in your placement score from 1 to 12.  You will then see a graph of all your scores for that track, as well as a detailed summary of your average performance.  Essentially, the lower your average, the better your performance.  The graph is displayed via a line graph, and better placements will be indicated in reverse order (y axis goes from 12 to 1 rather than 1 to 12).
